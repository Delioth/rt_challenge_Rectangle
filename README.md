This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

This is the Rectangle portion of a technical interview code challenge for Review Trackers, by Braden Menke.

The source code for this project is found in the src directory, with the webpage serving it located in public/index.html

Clicking a rectangle will pop up an alert with the name of the clicked rectangle.

The page containing the React Rectangle App is hosted at  [https://delioth.github.io/rt_challenge_Rectangle/](https://delioth.github.io/rt_challenge_Rectangle/). The built code can also be viewed from the "gh-pages" branch. It's possible to install the app from source using `npm install`. You may then build the app by running `npm run build`, or start a local server to host the app by running `npm start` in the project directory.

The other portion of this code challenge is a React Calendar app, and can be found at [https://github.com/Delioth/rt_challenge_Calendar](https://github.com/Delioth/rt_challenge_Calendar), and is deployed at [https://delioth.github.io/rt_challenge_Calendar/](https://delioth.github.io/rt_challenge_Calendar/).
